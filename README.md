This is the source code for a website that chooses random books for you off of a goodread user's shelf.

It uses Nokogirir and open URI to contact the goodreads api, active jobs with the suckerpunch backend and a mutex to make sure only one request is made at a time, and active mailer with sendgrid to send emails.

The style is sakura which can be found here https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura/blob/master/README.md
